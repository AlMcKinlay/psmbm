      Beach Mission is coming soon and we would love you to register your children. There will be
      activities every weekday for 0-17 year olds in six different age groups. Everyone is welcome,
      and activities are free (apart from a contribution for the outing). Activities include games,
      crafts, competitions, an outing, and interactive Bible based activities appropriate for each
      age group. Children and young people are welcome to attend whichever sessions they wish. Check
      out our age groups and session times here:
