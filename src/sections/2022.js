      Plans are well underway for this summer's Beach Mission when we will return to a full
      programme of activities for children and young people aged 0-17. We expect to open up the
      registration system early in July. If your child was registered last summer and you gave us
      permission to contact you, you should receive an email to tell you when bookings have opened.
      Otherwise, please just keep an eye on this website for further information.
