  Beach Mission will be back this summer, and all children and young people will be welcome to join in. There will be activities every weekday for 0-17 year olds in six different age groups. Everyone is welcome, and activities are free (apart from a contribution for the outing). Activities include games, crafts, competitions, an outing, and interactive Bible based activities appropriate for each age group.


  Children and young people are welcome to attend whichever sessions they wish.
